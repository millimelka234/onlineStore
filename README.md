Welcome to The Online Store project! This is a web application template designed to serve as a foundation for an online store specializing in hair products. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing products, adding them to a shopping cart, and completing purchases securely. The website features dynamic elements such as a product slider, category navigation, and a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing across various devices. Users can explore different product categories, view detailed product information, submit reviews, and proceed through the checkout process seamlessly. The codebase is structured with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making it easy to customize and extend to meet specific business requirements.

## Features
### 1. Product Slider
The website features a dynamic product slider that showcases various hair products. Each slide includes an image of the product, its title, and price. Users can easily navigate through different products using the slider.

### 2. Product Details
Users can click on different menu items to view details about specific product categories. The slider dynamically updates to display products related to the selected category, providing users with a seamless browsing experience.

### 3. Add to Cart
Interested users can add products to their shopping cart with a single click. The cart icon at the bottom left corner of the page displays the current number of items in the cart, providing users with a visual indication of their selections.

### 4. Checkout
Once users have selected their desired products, they can proceed to checkout. The integrated checkout form allows users to enter their personal and payment information securely. Users can review their order summary before finalizing the purchase.

### 5. Product Reviews
We believe in the power of customer feedback. Users have the opportunity to submit reviews for products they've purchased, including ratings and written feedback. This helps other shoppers make informed decisions and fosters a sense of community within our online store.

### 6. Responsive Design
The website is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Whether users are browsing at home or on the go, they can enjoy seamless access to our online store.
